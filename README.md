## Achievements in Super Mario 64:

### Cog Misalignment

Mario needs to land in a 1cm x 1cm floor jutting out between some walls, but the walls get in the way. I use desmos.com to assume Mario reached this floor, and worked backwards to see where he must launch off to reach this target within 0.1 seconds.

### Arctan Straining & the Iwerlipse

In the air, the control stick can do 2 things to Mario. It can displace Mario sideways by a constant speed, or it can accelerate him forwards or backwards. Usually it does a combination of the two, based on control stick tilt angle. Most people would tilt the control stick in a set angle at all times, but I helped find the optimal solution of following the Arctan function in terms of time.

### Pendulum Amplitude Sequence Map
<img src="pendulumAmplitudes.png?raw=true" width="640px">
Pendulums in the SM64 can swing with different acceleration, as if a force was applied to the pendulum. Due to this, the pendulum's next swing's amplitude seems almost random compared to the last swing, but the next amplitude of every initial amplitude is set. We can choose our acceleration, meaning every amplitude has 2 other different amplitudes values it can reach next. When connecting all amplitude values into a graph, it seems to form a planar graph in the shape of a ladder. Thus, I called this the "Pendulum Ladder Map."
